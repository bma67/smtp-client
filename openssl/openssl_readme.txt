In this folder, OpenSSL header files and libraries are stored for both Win32 and x64 architectures.

Due to huge size of those libraries, they are not commited in the Git repository.

1) Download the needed package from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
2) extract and keep "include" and "lib" folders for both Win32 and x64
